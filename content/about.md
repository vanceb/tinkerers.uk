## Background

Why do the **Tinkerers** exist?  

I am an engineer who is interested in a wide selection of things.  I get bored easily and try to learn new skills to keep my mind "entertained".

I was born in Torbay, but spent most of my working life in other parts of the country.  Most recently around the Reading area, where I was a member of the [Reading Hackspace](https://rlab.org.uk) where there were a number of others with similar interests.  Having moved back to Torbay I am missing the interaction with other people of similar interests and sharing ideas and knowledge.  As far as I can see, there is no similar group that exists locally.  So, I better start one!

## Create, Learn, Share

The **Tinkerers** are a group of people who like to create things, learn new skills, and share our knowledge, ideas and experience with each other.

## Where are we?

We usually meet monthly in the Torbay area, but we also have an online community.  We do not set a geographical boundary for involvement.  If you want to travel to a meeting, or just want to participate in our online community that's good.

To join the online community or if you want to come along to a meeting then please [Contact Us]({{< ref "/contact.md">}}).
