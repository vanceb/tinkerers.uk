## Create, Learn, Share

The **Tinkerers** are a group of people who like to create things, learn new skills, and share our knowledge and experience with each other.

## Where are we?

We usually meet monthly in the Torbay area of South Devon, but we also have an online community.  We do not set a geographical boundary for involvement.  If you want to travel to a meeting, or just want to participate in our online community that's good.

To join the online community or if you want to come along to a meeting then please [Contact Us]({{< ref "/contact.md">}}).
