<p>Why do the <strong>Tinkerers</strong> exist?</p>
<p>I am an engineer who is interested in a wide selection of things.  I get bored easily and try to learn new skills to keep my mind active.</p>
<p>I was born in Torbay, but spent most of my working life in other parts of the country.  Most recently around the Reading area, where I was a member of the <a href="https://rlab.org.uk">Reading Hackspace</a> where there were a number of others with similar interests.  Having moved back to Torbay I am missing the interaction with other people of similar interests and sharing ideas and knowledge.  As far as I can see, there is no similar group that exists locally.  So, I better start one!</p>
<h2 id="create-learn-share">Create, Learn, Share</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tinkerers</strong> are a group of people who like to create things, learn new skills, and share our knowledge, ideas and experience with each other.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-we">Where are we?</h2>
<p>We usually meet monthly in the Torbay area, but we also have an online community.  We do not set a geographical boundary for involvement.  If you want to travel to a meeting, or just want to participate in our online community that's good.</p>
<p>To join the online community or if you want to come along to a meeting then please [Contact Us]({{&lt; ref &quot;/contact.md&quot;&gt;}}).</p>
