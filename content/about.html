<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Why do the <strong>Tinkerers</strong> exist?</p>
<p>I am an engineer who is interested in a wide selection of things.  I get bored easily and try to learn new skills to keep my mind &quot;entertained&quot;.</p>
<p>I was born in Torbay, but spent most of my working life in other parts of the country.  Most recently around the Reading area, where I was a member of the <a href="https://rlab.org.uk">Reading Hackspace</a> where there were a number of others with similar interests.  Having moved back to Torbay I am missing the interaction with other people of similar interests and sharing ideas and knowledge.  As far as I can see, there is no similar group that exists locally.  So, I better start one!</p>
<h2 id="create-learn-share">Create, Learn, Share</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tinkerers</strong> are a group of people who like to create things, learn new skills, and share our knowledge, ideas and experience with each other.</p>
<h2 id="what-sort-of-things-are-we-interested-in">What sort of things are we interested in?</h2>
<p>The group has a mainly science, technology and engineering background, but our member's projects often include the arts.  As an example we have a member who is a musician and is interested in making DIY effects pedals and stage lighting.</p>
<p>The idea of the group is that you run with your own projects, with some assistance from others where you need it.  You may need help with some technical aspects of the project, or you have a great idea, but not know where to start.  Talking to people in the group either in-person or through our online community can be useful to help get your project off the ground.</p>
<p>Depending on your project and experience you may need to learn some new skills before you can start on your project.  Members will be able to help you break down the project so you can identify areas for research and learning.  They may also be able to mentor you through the project.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-become-a-member">Who can become a member?</h2>
<p>We are unable to provide supervision and safeguarding for our online community and in-person meet-ups.  We therefore only accept adults (18+) as members.  You will need to prove your age and identity before you can join the group.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-we">Where are we?</h2>
<p>We usually meet monthly in the Torbay area, but we also have an online community.  We do not set a geographical boundary for involvement.  If you want to travel to a meeting, or just want to participate in our online community that's good.</p>
<p>To join the online community or if you want to come along to a meeting then please [Contact Us]({{&lt; ref &quot;/contact.md&quot;&gt;}}).</p>
