## Who can join?

Individual members must be able to participate in adult groups both in-person and online.  We therefore only accept adults aged over 18 as members.  To verify your legal name and to confirm that you are over the age of 18, you will need to provide a form of official ID as part of the joining process.

## Privacy Policy

We keep the personal data you provide to us as part of the joining process.  This data is used as part of the record of our members.

You may ask to see the data we hold on you and you may request that we delete it.

## Diversity

We welcome all!  Diversity brings different perspectives and new ideas. 

We do not tolerate discrimination or abusive language in person or online.  If you feel that you are being treated unfairly because of your differences, no matter what they are, then please contact an admin.

### Safeguarding
We do not do background or criminal checks on our members and cannot therefore allow vulnerable adults or children to participate unsupervised.  Please get a parent or guardian to contact us so we can discuss participation.
