## Create, Learn, Share

* Are you creative?
* Do you enjoy learning new skills and solving problems?
* Would you like to share your skills and experience with others?

If any of the above apply to you then you need to come down and meet the Tinkerers!

## What are we are interested in?

This is not an exclusive list as new members bring new skills and interests, but it hopefully gives you a flavour of the group.

### Science

We have had a number of guest speakers covering science topics, the latest being on light and other electromagnetic waves.  The speaker brought a couple of experiments showing the refraction of light, and calculating the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar!

### Technology

Quite a few members are interested in technology projects and have brought them in for a "Show and Tell" sessions.  Sometimes this inspires others to try a project, sometimes they ask for help from other members, and sometimes they just want to show off their project!

### Art

Although the main focus of the group is science and technology based, a room full of technical people often make very "functional" items that could be greatly improved by an artistic eye.  Creative people who are interested in the intersection of technology and art are a great asset, and provide an alternative perspective.

## If you are interested in us then we are interested in you!

As we have said, we are an open and friendly group of creative people.  Although our current membership is heavily science and technology based this is not an exclusive club.  If any of the above interests you then please [Contact Us]({{< ref "/contact.md">}}).
