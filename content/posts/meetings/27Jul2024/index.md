## Meeting on 27 July 2024

### Micromouse Progress

Following our meeting on 25 May a couple of group members have joined the UK Micromouse and Robotics Society, [UKMARS](https://ukmars.org) and have been welcomed to their group.  One of our members has decided to aim for the maze solving robot competition, whilst a second has decided to compete in the "Dragster" race.

UKMARS has a basic robot design to allow people to get a headstart on their events and they provide PCBs to new members.  You then have to get the components and build the robot yourself.  Below is a photo of a newly built robot.  The next focus is to get to grips with the code that is also provided and to calibrate the robot so that it can move a prescribed distance, turn accurately, and sense its surroundings (the walls of the maze).  These capabilities are critical for the robot to be able to move around within the maze without hitting the walls.
