## Mini-series posts

This mini series will have 5 posts, which I will release as I write them up.  Once released they will be linked from here.

1. [Overview]({{< relref "overview" >}})
2. Design - This post
3. Prototyping - To follow
4. Custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) - To follow
5. 3D Printed Components - To Follow

## Break it down

When I am thinking about a project I try to capture all of the aspects that could make up the project and list them.  I think about whether I know how to do each of the parts.  If I don't know how to do them, I do some research and also think about how critical it would be to the project if I couldn't get that part working.  If they are risky then I want to prototype that aspect on its own to prove that I can do it.

### Art project break-down of questions

* Can I make the display I want using 600 LEDs?
  * How can I drive 600 LEDs? **(Research and Prototype)**
    * How much current/power does 600 LEDs take? **(Research)**
    * What refresh rate can I achieve? **(Research and Prototype)**
  * Can I write the code to make the art project look impressive?
    * I have driven strips of LEDs for previous projects and understand how to send the data, but complex moving displays are new to me.  I reckon I could write the code, but it would take considerable effort.
    * Has anyone else done this, and is there already code that does what I want? **(Research)**
  * What size board do I need to mount the 600 LEDs in the pattern I want? **(Prototype)**
  * How can I mount the flexible LED tape so that it stays where I want it when mounted on the wall? **(Prototype)**
