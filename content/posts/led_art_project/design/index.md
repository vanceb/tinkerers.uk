## Break it down

When I am thinking about a project I try to capture all of the aspects that could make up the project and list them.  I think about whether I know how to do each of the parts.  If I don't know how to do them, I do some research and also think about how critical it would be to the project if I couldn't get that part working.  If they are risky then I want to prototype that aspect on its own to prove that I can do it.
