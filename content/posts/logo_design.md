## Everybody needs a logo!

We wanted a logo for the website which reflects the qualities of the group.

### Start simple

To kick off the design we started with a "T" shape to reflect the "Tinkerers" initial letter.

### More geometric

The first was a good start, but being an engineer it was a bit free-form for me.  I wanted to constrain the lines to a more geometric set of shapes.  I also liked this logo as it looks a bit like a hammer, the tinkerers tool ðŸ˜„, and it is *broken into pieces*!

### Tame the curves

The curved elements look a bit too long, distoring the overall shape. So, more geometry applied to make these elements into quadrants, and the bottom curved element was removed to make the logo more like a capital "T".

### Make the logo squarer

The logo is too tall.  Website logos need to be usable in a square format for things like the browser "favicon". Dropping the bottom element gets us to the logo we are using on the website.

### Colour

The only thing left to resolve is the logo colour.  The shocking pink works well with the basic site greyscale colours.
